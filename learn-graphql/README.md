/* A quick setup to learn and play around with graph QL queries.

To exercise graph QL queries:
- Change directory to "server"
- npm install
- run "node app"
- Navigate to http://localhost:8000/graphql
- Create queries

- Check app.js file. Can switch out the schemas to play around with. Uncomment the schema you wish to use and be sure to comment out the other. There are currently two schemas:
  a) books and authors schema which has mock data that is declared locally in its schema file
  b) starwars api that uses swapi.dev endpoint. 
- Working on including all the field types for Star Wars Api
